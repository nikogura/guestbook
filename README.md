A really simple implementation of your classic guestbook hello world app.

Why?  I wanted to play with some database stuff in go.

I also needed a frontend/backend app to mess with as a subject for some infrastructre projects.

This isn't going to win any points, but as long as it stands up and does *something*, it's good enough.
